    <p class="text">The resort we stayed at was the Crown Paradise Club in Cancun.
    It is an all inclusive resort with many amenities. One of the best parts 
    of the resort is the location. It is located in the hotel zone of Cancun
    and in our room we had an amazing view of the ocean. With it being an
    all-inclusive resort everything is included. There are many resturants 
    to dine at ranging from Mexican, Italian, French, and other international
    cuisine.</p>

<h2>My Wife</h2>
    <p>My wife is the most amazing person ever. Going to 
    <a href="https://www.mexicancaribbean.travel/cancun/" title="Learn more about Cancun!">Cancun</a> 
    with her was a blast! Anyone who knows her, knows how kind and friendly 
    she is to everyone. That was one of the first things I noticed and loved 
    about her. We had attended the same Junior High and <a href="https://ogdenhigh.ogdensd.org" title="Ogden High School">High School</a> but were 
    never really friends. We did end up going to a dance together though but 
    apparently I never talked to her at it. I hopefully have made up for it 
    now. Below is a picture of our dance and a recreation of that picture 
    after our wedding.</p>

            beach, and ate lunch. After lunch we drove golf carts all around 
            the island.</td>
